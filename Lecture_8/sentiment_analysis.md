# Sentiment Analysis using nltk Package

If you want to run this program without installing `nltk`, just `cd` to the `Lecture_8` folder and then execute the code. Else, you'll have to install the `nltk` package and download `vader_lexicon` using

```bash
python -m pip install nltk
```

then

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
```
