# Disclaimer:

Note that the files of this lecture uses a slightly modded simpleimage library. This is to ensure that the modules are automatically installed if they are not. Also you should `cd` to the Lecture_9 folder before running these codes, or the code may not run correctly. If you want to run the code from the root folder of the repo, replace

```python
from simpleimage.simpleimage_modded import SimpleImage
```

with

```python
from Lecture_9.simpleimage.simpleimage_modded import SimpleImage
```

Also if you want to run the unmodified modules, replace that line with

```python
from simpleimage.simpleimage import SimpleImage
```

or if running from the root folder of the repo,

```python
from Lecture_9.simpleimage.simpleimage import SimpleImage
```
