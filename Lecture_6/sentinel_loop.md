# Sentinel Loops

Write a program that prompts the user for numbers until the user types -1, then output the total of the numbers. In this case, -1 is called a sentinel value

Here is an example run of the program:

```
Type a number: 10
Type a number: 20
Type a number: 30
Type a number: -1
total is 60
```
